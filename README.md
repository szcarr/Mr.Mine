A program that runs ontop of the game "Mr.Mine"

Program was made because i want the steam achievements without grinding for 8 real life years.
The game needs to run on your main monitor. Else it will not click on Mr.Mine game window

The program automates currently these things:

    *Automated chest collecting in the mine

    *Automated chest collecting from the metal detector

    *Automated gem crafting

    *Automated selling of minerals
    
    *Automated excavations, collecting rewards, burying and forfeiting rewards.
    
    *Automated ticket usage (Spends tickets on chests)

More coming in the future
